ocamlweb is a literate programming tool for Objective Caml

The invocation is

	ocamlweb <options> <files>

It creates a single LaTeX document with both documentation and code
(implementations and interfaces) extracted from the given files.
Documentation is inserted into ocaml files as comments and thus your
files will ever compile, no matter the fact you use ocamlweb or not.
See the manual for options.

COMPILATION
============

  You need Objective Caml to compile the sources.
 
  1. Compile with "make". It creates a binary file "ocamlweb".


INSTALLATION
============

  1. Copy this binary file where you want,
     either by editing the Makefile and doing "make install"
     or by copying the file "by hand".

  2. Copy the LaTeX package `ocamlweb.sty' somewhere in your LaTeX
     input path (one of the directories listed in $TEXINPUTS). This
     file is needed to compile the documents produced by ocamlweb
     with LaTeX.
