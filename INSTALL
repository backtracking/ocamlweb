COMPILATION (source distribution only)
======================================

  You need Objective Caml (>= 2.01) to compile the sources.
 
  1. Compile with "make". It creates a binary file "ocamlweb".

  If your platform does not support native compilation, do instead
  "make byte" to build the bytecode executable (still named ocamlweb).


INSTALLATION
============

  1. Edit the Makefile and modify the configuration section at the
     beginning of this file.

  2. type "make install"

  Notes:

  The following paths are recommended:

       BINDIR = /usr/local/bin
       TEXDIR = /usr/share/texmf/tex/latex/misc

  For some TeX installations, it may be necessary to run the
  command
     
       mktexlsr	

  by hand to make ocamlweb.sty accessible by LaTeX.
      
  Alternatively, you may copy the needed files by hand: copy the binary 
  file "ocamlweb" in some directory that exists in your PATH environment 
  variable, and copy the file "ocamlweb.sty" somewhere in your LaTeX 
  input path (one of the directories listed in $TEXINPUTS). This file is 
  needed to compile the documents produced by ocamlweb with LaTeX. 


TEST (source distribution only)
===============================

  You can run "make check" to `bootstrap' ocamlweb i.e. to apply it to
  its own code. If everything works fine, it will create a DVI document
  test/ocamlweb.dvi.
