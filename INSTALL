COMPILATION
============

  You need Objective Caml (>= 2.01) to compile the sources.
 
  1. Compile with "make". It creates a binary file "ocamlweb".

     If your platform supports native compilation, do instead "make opt"
     to get a native-code binary (still named "ocamlweb").


INSTALLATION
============

  1. Copy the binary file "ocamlweb" where you want,
     either by editing the Makefile and doing "make install"
     or by copying the file `by hand'.

  2. Copy the LaTeX package "ocamlweb.sty" somewhere in your LaTeX
     input path (one of the directories listed in $TEXINPUTS). This
     file is needed to compile the documents produced by ocamlweb
     with LaTeX.


TEST
====

  You can run "make check" to `bootstrap' ocamlweb i.e. to apply it to
  its own code. If everything works fine, it will create a DVI document
  test/ocamlweb.dvi.
